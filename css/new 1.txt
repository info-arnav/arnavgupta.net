<p>Our team name, INCATUS, is wordplay on the Latin word 'incitatio', meaning swiftness. Also, the font for our team name was also perfectly handpicked so as to showcase our precision and attention to detail. Our logo, the furious horse, showcases our aggression, precision and the sheer horsepower of our car. Our team colors are black and blue, Black showcases our domination over the other teams in the competition, and the combination of blue represents our wisdom, confidence, intelligence and futuristic views.

The name of our car represents our desire to be fast, faster than any car previously designed. We have applied many scientific concepts in our car, including drag, drag coefficient, minimal downforce, pressure on the frontal area. We have looked at previous scientific studies to assist us in designing the car.
